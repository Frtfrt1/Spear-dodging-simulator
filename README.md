# Spear-dodging-simulator


Hello this is "Spear Dodging Simulator".
You can move you character with arrow keys(<-, and ->).
The score goes up if a spear(or bombs) reaches the end of the screen.
If a spear touches you before it reaches the bottom, you lose 1 hp.


There are some items that may help you:
--
Time bombs : Stops the game for a few seconds. 

Heart giver : Gives you 1 hp.

Rainbow extract : Gives you 1 hp and reduces damage for next hit.

There's a special attack that hurts you a lot:
--
Atomic bomb : Deals you 3 hp and deal 1 hp if rainbow extract is active.




Have a great time playing it!
